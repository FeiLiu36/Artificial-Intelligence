**The main work:**

Facial Composite is to synthesize two target pictures into one pictures 

**The method it used:** 

- using **pg-GAN** to create high-resolution human faces
- using Latent Variable Evolution (**LVE**)

    Aim at exploring the feasibility of generating image from procedure text for retrieval problem.
It belongs to **NLP**, to solve a problem of 



The simplest way is linear scan

index the document-boolean retrieval model

This paper studies food-to-recipe and recipe-to-food retrieval

>They specially use a GAN with one generator and dual discriminators

two-level ranking loss
