#  Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN)


![country](https://img.shields.io/badge/country-China-red)

This is my  research summary on Generative Adversarial Networks and I sort them into:

- Traditional GAN
- Application GAN
- Multi-Objective GAN



**Introduction of GAN**

> 

If you want to know more about more details of the derivation or the difficult of GAN’s training, you can see the part of [Traditional GAN](# Traditional-GAN)



**Why is there an “s” after GANs?**

> It means GAN and its variants



## [Traditional-GAN](1-Traditional-GAN)

The development of some famous GAN models including <u>Vanilla GAN</u>, <u>DCGAN</u>, <u>WGAN</u>

## [Application GAN](2-Application-GAN)

Some applications of GAN including the use of defense

## [Multi-Objective GAN](Multi-Objective-GAN)

Add multi-objective and evolutionary algorithm into GAN
