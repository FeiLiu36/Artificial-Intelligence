>
>    Classically, modeling and rerendering a real scene requires full reconstruction of its geometry and reflectance. From captured images, scene geometry is usually reconstructed by structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo.
>
>    Now a practical device - modern cellphone that has a camera and a built-in flash light â€“ and capture flash images to acquire spatially varying **BRDFs**. Such a device only acquires reflectance samples under collocated light and view.

**Aims**

> We aim to model geometry and appearance of complex real scenes from multi-view unstructured flash images

Neural Reflectance Fields are a continuous function neural representation that **implicitly models both scene geometry and reflectance**.

**Summary**

> This paper studies the problem of **surface reconstruction** through learning **surface mesh** via **implicit functions**, where implicit functions are implemented as multi-layer perceptrons (**MLPs**) with rectified linear units (**ReLU**).
