**The main work:**

> Facial Composite is to synthesize two target pictures into one pictures 

**The methods it used:** 

> - [ ] using **pg-GAN** to create high-resolution human faces
> - [x] using Latent Variable Evolution (**LVE**) to guide the search through a process of interactive evolution 

**Its contribution:**

> It extends LVE with the ability to freeze certain features discovered during the search, and enables a more controlled user-recreation of target images.

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary><p>


**The main work:**

> Aim at exploring the feasibility of generating image from procedure text for retrieval problem. The specific content of the text is food recipe

It belongs to **NLP**, to solve a problem of information retrieval

The simplest way is linear scan

index the document-boolean retrieval model 

**The methods it used:** 

This paper studies food-to-recipe and recipe-to-food retrieval

>They specially use a GAN with one generator and dual discriminators

two-level ranking loss
