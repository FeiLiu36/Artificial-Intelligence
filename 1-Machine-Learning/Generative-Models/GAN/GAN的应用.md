# GAN的应用



1. 最简单的图片生成

2. 风格迁移 Image-to-Image Translation

   UNIT: UNsupervised Image-to-image Translation Networks

3. Domain Adaptation domain-adversarial neural network (DANN)

   《Domain-Adversarial Training of Neural Networks》最早将对抗网络的思想引入到迁移学习领域

   unsupervised domain adaption 问题

4. 图像编辑

## Unsupervised Learning



## Semi-supervised Learning

The earliest work is《Semi-supervised Learning with Deep Generative Models》by **Kingma**.

About what is **Semi-supervised Learning**

Then there is another work 《Semi-Supervised Learning with Generative Adversarial Networks》by **Odena**





## 用GAN来帮助分类

UNSUPERVISED AND SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING WITH CATEGORICAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS (CatGAN)



对于分类问题，从概率的角度来讲

$p(x)$ 包含了 $p(y|x)$ 的信息
