# Multi-Objective Optimization Survey

two survey of this field:

- Nonlinear Multiobjective Optimization by Miettinen 1998
- Multicriteria Optimization by Ehrgott 2005


Two main method to solve multi-objective optimization:

### gradient-based multi-objective optimization

**multiple gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) Development**

[Multiple-gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) for multiobjective optimization](./Multiple-gradient-descent-algorithm(MGDA)-for-multiobjective-optimization.pdf) by Désidéri (2012)



Above all use multi-objective Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (**KKT**) conditions and find a descent direction that decreases all objectives. This approach was extended to **stochastic gradient descent**:
