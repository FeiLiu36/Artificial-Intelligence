# 手写数字

## 1、minist数据集准备

First download from the [website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

We will get four files including training set images\labels and test set images \labels.

The training set contains 60000 examples, and the test set 10000 examples.

The first 5000 examples of the test set are taken from the original NIST training set. The last 5000 are taken from the original NIST test set. The first 5000 are cleaner and easier than the last 5000.

These files are not in any standard image format. You have to write your own (very simple) program to read them.

I give you an reference [code]().

## 2、利用scikit-learn库来做
