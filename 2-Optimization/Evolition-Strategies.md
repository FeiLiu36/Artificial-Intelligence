Evolutionary Strategies (ES) are a popular family of **black-box** zeroth-order optimization algorithms which rely on search distributions to efficiently optimize a large variety of objective functions.

Examples of black-box optimization methods include [Simulated Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing), [Hill Climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing) and [Nelder-Mead method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelderâ€“Mead_method).



**Evolution Strategies (ES)** is one type of black-box optimization algorithms, born in the family of **Evolutionary Algorithms (EA)**
